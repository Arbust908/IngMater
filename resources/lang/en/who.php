                <br>
                That is why we made the decision to work with INGMATER. Together with them we analyze the process in plant to make the decision of what types of tests were going to undergo the raw material. Once they obtained the results of the analyzes and having studied our processes, they generated a report, focusing on those points that are relevant for obtaining good pieces, arguing with solid theoretical bases their observations.',
